                        When in a trial, think, "Is Heavenly Father surprized by this trial?"  He knew beforehand what you would be facing, and put you in this place when that happened.  He has confidence in you.

                        Listen to/read talks by Grandaddy.  I believe he was quoted in sacrament meeting today.

                        Today, I gave a talk in Sacrament Meeting, and I can say that I felt the Spirit strongly leading up to it and through it.  After it was over, I looked long and hard at the inside front covers of my hymnbook and copy of Preach My Gospel, where it says the name of my mission, the names of my companions, and the people who I taught, and I closed my eyes, remembering for a minute.  All I could feel was love, I believe amplified by the Spirit, for my mission and the experiences I had.  The look of the land surrounding Prosser, Benton City, Washougal, Toppenish, Yakima, Richland, and Kennewick.  The feeling of the ever-present breezes of the TriCities and through the Gorge.  The awesome souls I met and taught and were taught by.  The love of the Gospel and the Doctrine of Christ.  I want to shout out to my companions and how much I loved being their companions (even through the struggles that we might have had amongst ourselves).  I grew spiritually a lot during my mission.  I pray now I will hold this in my heart more as the years pass, and cherish what I learned from it.  I felt in those few minutes of reflection the same Spirit, almost as strong as I had experienced it in the mission field.  It's the kind of feeling that you get where you know the magnitude of God's love for you, where you know that despite your daily imperfections you have been redeemed, where you know the Atonement of Christ is real and raises your soul to a higher plane, where you feel your soul refreshed and renewed and all is calm.  That was my mission to me.  This was God's mission for me.  <a href="https://www.facebook.com/search/str/%23wkm4ever/keywords_top">#wkm4ever</a>

                        <em>Challenge:</em>  Attend the temple once this week<br />
                        Taken when Bishop said that he has been married to his wife for nearly 40 years.  Though I am sure there were several other temples in the area, I realized that there weren't nearly the same amount of temples on the earth now than there were back then.  I've realized that in all technicality, the Church could have left the amount of temples in the valleys here in Utah the same.  Perhaps, though, during the timeframe that I'm looking at, the Church has placed a greater emphasis on temple attendence, which is why now we have many temples that is geared toward more people attending than before.  I notice now that I need to be attending the temple more.  I know that part of why I believe I'm thinking about this is because Mom talked to the collective family a couple days ago and told me about the importance of attendance, and especially since President Thomas S. Monson taught us about temples last General Conference.  I haven't gone to the temple for much lately.  I need to go to attend to help those who aren't able to do the ordinances themselves, and also because I am seeking revelation for myself in my life.

                        When it comes to the sacrament, remember that the prayer given is also scripture.  We can apply scripture.  I would like to apply the sacrament scriptures to me.  I've surrounded the edits in "[ ]" so that you know the edits.  (In order to compare the original texts, see D&C 20:77, 79)

                        Remember that Christ is the Good Shepherd.  He has the power to save and by relying on His Atonement, we can understand what He says in John 10:9, where He is the door; He is the path to salvation.

                        What will I do for mom today?  I will hug her, tell her I love her. I will take the dishes off of the table and take care of them for her.  I will play games with her and spend good time with her.  I will go off to bed and not be distracted by my technology.  I will keep myself clean.  I will focus on her advice and will follow her example.<br />
                        <br />
                        I have a few things which I need to refocus with.  I need to clean my room.  I need to power through the things which I need to do to prepare myself for DevMountain in August.  I need to kneel and pray more.  I need to use the Atonement more often.  I need to focus on praying better.  I need to study the scriptures.  I need to refocus on my responsibilities again.
